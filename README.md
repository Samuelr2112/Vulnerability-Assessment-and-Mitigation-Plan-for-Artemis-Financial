# Vulnerability Assessment Report
# Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment for Artemis Financial's software application. The objective is to identify security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and hardcoded credentials, and recommend measures to mitigate these issues. The assessment covers both manual code reviews and static testing of the applicationâ€™s dependencies. By identifying potential threats and weaknesses, this report provides detailed recommendations to enhance the security and robustness of the software.

# Features
The project begins with an analysis of the client's needs, emphasizing secure communications, compliance with global security standards, and protection against common external threats like phishing and ransomware. The report highlights key areas of security that require attention, including architecture review, input validation, API security, and cryptography. Following this, a manual review of the code identifies specific vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and sensitive data exposure. Static testing results, including dependency checks, further highlight vulnerabilities in libraries such as Log4j. Each identified issue is accompanied by a mitigation plan, including steps like implementing prepared statements, encoding user inputs, and updating outdated dependencies.

# Files
The project includes the vulnerability assessment report, which details findings from the manual review and static testing. Screenshots of the static testing results and examples of refactored code are provided to support the recommendations. The report also includes a mitigation plan to address each vulnerability identified during the assessment.
